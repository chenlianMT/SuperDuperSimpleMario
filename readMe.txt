Run the main_MVP.py file in Python2!!!!
(MVP--Minimum viable product)
You may need to install some fonts like Unifont and Electrolize.

Of course you can run main.py. But you need to install threading, pyaudio and maybe wave modules first. 

Iâ€™m sorry for the inconvenience of Windows users. Some of the paths are not adapted for Windows and you can change it by yourselves. Thank you.

Also, thanks for Xingyun Zhang who made the super cute stick figure for me.
